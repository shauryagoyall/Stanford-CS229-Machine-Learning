# Stanford CS229 Machine Learning

It has solutions to both Autumn 2018 and Summer 2019 assignments. I merged the extra questions from autumn 2018 to the summer 2019 questions. The code is in jupyter notebooks and writeup in pdf in individual problem set folder. This repository's main aim is to share my work during learning rather than provide a reference hence the writeups also involve the rough work and wrong results I got before correcting them.

Please let me know if you spot any errors!
